# Colleague name - Professional Development plan

The aim of this plan is to help me support you in your ongoing professional development. I want you to be able to achieve your career goals - not just at this company, but beyond. Your goals don’t have to be related to ForUsAll’s business. They’re for you.

## What is your personal mission statement?

_This is your north star. For example, a possible mission statement is to work on technology that makes the world more equal. Another example of a mission statement is to work at startups building world-class products that change the world._

## What is your personal goal?

_This is where you want to see yourself in 5 or 10 years. One long-term goal is to be the founder of a generational tech company. Other long-term goals are to be a senior individual contributor engineer, or an engineering manager, or a product manager at a large tech giant._

## What are your near-term steps?

_What measurable, actionable steps bring you closer to your goal?_

* **Action**: What activities do you need to undertake to achieve this objective?
* **Support**: What support from leadership do you need to achieve this objective?
* **Outcome**: What is the measurable outcome of achieving this objective?
* **Timescale**: When do you hope to achieve this objective?
